# Sales-Dashboard-using-Excel
This Sales Dashboard project was created using Excel with pivot tables as the main component to analyze and visualize sales data. This dashboard is designed to provide deep insights into sales performance through various important metrics and interactive visualizations. It includes sales performance summaries such as total sales, number of products sold, total sales after tax, and average customer ratings. Interactive filter features allow users to filter data by city, customer type, product line, and payment method. Data visualization includes graphs of monthly sales trends, payment method distribution, number of products sold per category, and average customer ratings per city.

The steps of creating a dashboard involve preparing data, creating a pivot table, creating charts from the pivot table, and arranging these elements in a dashboard sheet. With a neat and consistent design, the dashboard makes it easy for users to understand sales data and make better business decisions. Through the use of Excel and pivot tables, this dashboard provides powerful and easily accessible analytical tools to effectively manage and evaluate sales performance.
